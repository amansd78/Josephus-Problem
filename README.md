# Josephus-Problem
Near the start of the Great Jewish Revolt (66-73AD), Roman General Vespasian1
and his son Titus2
laid siege on the city of Yodfat, whose troops were commanded by Yosef ben-Matityahu3
. On the 47th
and last day of the siege, a deserter of the Jewish forces reached the Romans and betrayed the city. On
the next day a small group of Romans led by Titus himself managed to scale the walls and open the
gates to let in the entire Roman army. Taken by surprise, the Jews were furthermore confounded by a
thick mist, and the Romans quickly took hold of the summit, pursuing the inhabitants down the eastern
slope.
And for the Romans, they so well remembered what they had suffered during the siege,
that they spared none, nor pitied any, but drove the people down the precipice from the
citadel, and slew them as they drove them down; at which time the difficulties of the place
hindered those that were still able to fight from defending themselves; for as they were distressed in the narrow streets, and could not keep their feet sure along the precipice, they
were overpowered with the crowd of those that came fighting them down from the citadel.
—Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews, Book III, Ch. 7, sec. 34
Meanwhile, Yosef ben-Matityahu hid in one of the many caves around the area alongside 40 other
Jewish citizens. Even though Yosef was in favour of surrendering, most of the people alongside him
prefered death rather than surrendering to the Romans. However, since in the Talmud suicide is considered a sin, they chose to draw lots and to kill each other. When there were only two people left,
Yosef and another man, Yosef managed to convince the other person to give themselves up rather than
letting one of them kill the other and then commit suicide.
However, in this extreme distress, he was not destitute of his usual sagacity; but trusting
himself to the providence of God, he put his life into hazard [in the manner following]:
”And now,” said he, ”since it is resolved among you that you will die, come on, let us commit our mutual deaths to determination by lot. He whom the lot falls to first, let him be
killed by him that hath the second lot, and thus fortune shall make its progress through us
all; nor shall any of us perish by his own right hand, for it would be unfair if, when the
rest are gone, somebody should repent and save himself.” This proposal appeared to them
to be very just; and when he had prevailed with them to determine this matter by lots, he
drew one of the lots for himself also.
—Flavious Josephus, The Wars of the Jews, Book III, Ch. 8, sec. 7
After they were captured and taken to the Roman general Vespasian, Yosef managed to earn Vespasian’s favour, who spared Yosef’s life, deciding to keep him as his slave and interpreter. Having fully
defected to the Romans during the Great Revolt, as well as becoming a close friend of Titus, after Vespasian became Imperator of the Roman Empire, Yosef was granted his freedom and assumed the name
Flavious Josephus, in honor of the family name of Vespasian and Titus.
In this project different algorithms were coded using the python to demonstrate the time-complexity of different algorithms and as result we learned efficient way of writing the algorithms
